C mathLibrary
A comprehensive mathematics library implemented in C, offering functions for calculus, linear algebra, basic and complex arithmetic operations, and more.
- Basic arithmetic operations roots and powers 
- Complex numbers arithmetic 
- Calculus 
- Linear algebra (matrix operations)
- Geometry
This library is an ongoing project and is actively being developed. I plan to add more features and functionalities in the future, including:
- Additional calculus operations
- Advanced linear algebra functions
- Performance optimizations and enhancements
I would love to hear from the community community anything you would like to see in the library. Stay tuned for updates!
